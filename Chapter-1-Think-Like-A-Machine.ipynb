    "## How Mathematicians Think\n",
    "A mathematician and a physicist are in an old cabin in the woods. With them is their MBA friend who is collecting data on how mathematicians and physicists think. The MBA poses the following problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here's a kettle, a tap with running water, a box of matches, and a functioning stove. Your task is to boil a kettle full of water. How would you do it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The physicist pipes up first. \"I'd fill the kettle with the water from the tap and light the stove with the match. We then wait, let's see...\", and he proceeds to calculate the time it would take for the water to boil given the barometric pressure and humidity at their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematician says, \"Yes, I'd do the same thing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The MBA is a bit disappointed. This is a null result and null results don't get published #@!. But then he thinks of an ingenious second experiement. He says, \"Here's an already fully filled kettle on the stove. Your task is to boil a kettle full of water. How would you do it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the physicist is first to answer. \"Are you joking? I'd light the stove and wait 3 minutes and 24 seconds (plus or minus 8 seconds) for the water to boil.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematician is looking out the window, completely bored by all this experimentation. He sighs, \"It's trivial...I'd just pour out the water, reducing the problem to the one that's already been solved.\""

In this case we can get away with the brute force method of trying out parameter values. But even in relative simple problems the brute force method is not feasible. The method that's most commonly used is called *Gradient Descent*. We'll see the details in the next chapter.\n",

Based on the properties of the cost function at this value, the next set of parameter values is chosen. How this choice is made is a property of the particular iterative method that is chosen. The cost for this next set of parameter values is now calculated and the process unfolds as it did before to choosing the next set of parameter values. The process ends when the minimum value is arrived at.\n",
